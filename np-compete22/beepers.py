# Dijkstra's algorithm?
'''
 Your job is to write a computer program that 
 finds the length of the shortest path that 
 will get Karel from her starting position, 
 to each of the beepers, and return back again 
 to the starting position.

 Only 4 directions.
 Karel starts where?
 Check column by column?

'''

# Pre process the map. Every beeper will point to its closest beeper.
