# Breadth First Search

BFS is a technique for traversing a graph. 

It is commonly used for "Shortest Path" problems.
In BFS, the cells with shortest path length L are visited first, then adjacent cells with path length L+1 and so on.
Every node reached by a BFS algorithm has a path length equal to the previous node's path length +1. The first appearance of any cell in our traversal will necessarily give the shortest path to that cell.
